# acando-npm-react-context-starter

A starting point if you would like to create a component that follows the Provider / Consumer pattern using React's context API.

The only thing you need to contribute is your own logic inside `MyProvider.js` (remember to rename the files and functions to describe your own functionality).

Documentation is coming.

1. Develop locally using `npm link`.
2. Compile with `npm run compile`.
3. Publish.
